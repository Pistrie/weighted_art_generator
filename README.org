#+title: weighted_art_generator

This repository generates random art by combining a bunch of assets.

[[file:img/preview.png]]

** Information

Each class of items has a rarity; common, rare, or epic. Commons have a weight of 3, rare a weight of 2, and epic items have a weight of 1. This means that common items are roughly three times as likely to spawn compared to epic items.

** Usage

*** Mix tasks

Run either the ~kickoff~ or the ~kickoff.scarcity~ tasks.

~kickoff~ requires a parameter for the amount of images to be generated.
#+begin_example
mix kickoff 10
#+end_example

~kickoff.scarcity~ has an optional parameter for the amount of processes that will be used to generate the images. It will only generate a third of the possible images in order to create the valued /artificial scarcity/.
#+begin_example
mix kickoff.scarcity
mix kickoff.scarcity 400
#+end_example

~possible_combinations~ prints the amount of combinations that are possible.
#+begin_example
mix possible_combinations
#+end_example

*** Code

Call ~WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff/1~ to create as many images as you want, up to the amount the combination of assets allows.

#+begin_src elixir
WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff(15)
#+end_src

You can also call ~WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff_scarcity/1~ to generate the images.

#+begin_src elixir
WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff_scarcity(100)
#+end_src

** This is not meant as an NFT generator

The idea of the generated images is the same, but this was made because the idea itself is interesting to me. NFTs are a scam, don't invest in them.
