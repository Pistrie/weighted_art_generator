#+title: weighted_art_generator

This repository generates random art by combining a bunch of assets.

** Information

Each class of items has a rarity; common, rare, or epic. Commons have a weight of 3, rare a weight of 2, and epic items have a weight of 1. This means that common items are roughly three times as likely to spawn compared to epic items.

** Usage

Call ~WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff_scarcity/0~ to generate the images. It will only generate a third of the possible images in order to create the valued /artificial scarcity/

#+begin_src elixir
WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff_scarcity()
#+end_src

You can also call ~WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff/1~ to create as many images as the combination of assets allow

#+begin_src elixir
WeightedArtGenerator.kickoff(15)
#+end_src

** This is not meant as an NFT generator

The idea of the generated images is the same, but this was made because the idea itself is interesting to me. NFTs are a scam, don't invest in them
